Unemployment is a term referring to individuals who are employable and seeking a job but are unable to find a job. Furthermore, 
it is those people in the workforce or pool of people who are available for work that does not have an appropriate job. Usually 
measured by the unemployment rate, which is
 dividing the number of unemployed people by the total number of people in the workforce, unemployment serves as one of the 
 indicators of an economy’s status.</b></h4>

      <h4><b>Of all the daunting challenges facing most nations of the world, unemployment has become a general phenomenon. 
	  Indeed, even for the working class, fears of losing jobs are causing so many sleepless nights and almost everyone now 
	  thinks of other workable plans in the event an unexpected happens.

Yet, if other nations have various excuses for the inability to create jobs for their citizens, Nigeria should 
be an exception. So many untapped avenues stare the nation in the eye while leaders seemingly turn a blind eye 
thereby allowing the problem of unemployment to escalate. Even as the government is not creating jobs, the few
 individuals who through their ingenuity have been able to engage a good
 number of job seekers are being overburdened with taxes of various forms forcing many entrepreneurs either to 
 fold up or to retrench most of their employees.

    </div>
    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-light-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Corruption</h3>
      <p>Corruption has found its way into the entire social structure of Nigeria robbing the country of a vibrant economic base. </p>
	  
	  <h3>Low Economic</h3>
<p>Low economic is one of the causes of unemployment in Nigeria. According to an overview by the World Bank, 
the economic growth in Nigeria has remained muted.</p>
<h3> Poor Infrastructure (e.g. Power Supply):</h3>
	
    </div>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3> Rural Urban Migration:</h3>
      <p>Lack of social amenities makes the rural life unattractive. 
Consequently, most Nigerian youths move to urban areas with hopes of securing lucrative employment in the industries.</p>
    
	<h3>Lack of employable skills</h3>
<p>In a report published by the World Economic Forum in 2018, it was stated that it is only people who are equipped with futureproof skills 
that can take advantage of new opportunities through continuous retraining and upskilling.</p>
	</div>

    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-dark-grey w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Rapid population growth</h3>
      <p>The population growth in Nigeria has been averaged 2.6% annually. 
	  If the population is growing at a rate not as high as the employment creation, there won’t be any cause for alarm. But the number of
	  people has outnumbered the available resources, so there is a problem on the mountain.</p>
<h3>The collapse of the manufacturing sector</h3> 
 </div>
    <div class="w3-col l3 m6 w3-black w3-container w3-padding-16">
      <h3>Poor Quality Control in the Educational System</h3>
      <p>Due to the rapid expansion of the educational system in Nigeria which leads to increase in the supply of graduates above the corresponding demand for them,
	  there is a significant decline in the quality of training learners obtain in the nation’s tertiary institutions. 
	  This contributes to the problem of the youth unemployment in Nigeria.
The Nigerian economy has been compromised and abused by corruption to the extent that 
it is too weak to absorb this large number of graduates.</p>

      <h3>Solutions to Uemployment</h3>
      <p>First there is need for the Nigeria Government to play its constitutional role by providing infrastructure to 
	  make business climate investment friendly. This will encourage investors to invest and there by create jobs in order to absorb the unemployed youths.<br><br>

Second, since corruption is a major cause of unemployment in Nigeria, there is the need for anti-corruption war to root out corruption in the polity. 
There is need to address the root causes of corruption and address it from in order to greatly minimize corruption.<br><br>

Third, there is need for government to invest more in education. Here, we mean the kind of education that will enable 
the youth to become job creators instead of job seekers.<br><br>

Fourth, there is need to provide infrastructural that will provide enable young Nigerians to create employments. Some of these include electricity, portable drinking water, and good roads. Provision of infrastructure would create an atmosphere that is conducive for investment.</p>

		  <p class="w3-large"><strong>I just finished secondary school at 19 years and getting admission. 
The stress of registering and trying to do the work as a fresher wasn’t an easy one but I always try hard to study very day because my dad’s “Study very hard, try hard to graduate with a first class and jobs will be looking for you. Even before you are done with your youth service” never leaves my head.
The number of times I slept in my hostel is far less than the days I slept in the class because I was studying hard. My family was not that rich but the thing is I never owed any fees.
Before I got to my third year, I had already being tagged a “booky”. Booky became a nickname I bear till I graduated. A lot of students meet for tutorials but I was strict and stingy with my study time anyways. I made sure I bought my lecturer’s handouts and also the books they recommend.
</p>

“You this boy, e be like say you no work today abi” came the voice of the contractor, breaking me free from my thoughts.
“No vex, Oga” I replied and placed the pan of cement on my head while fighting the tears in my eyes.
“Because he go school he think say na him better pass everybody” said someone behind me but I didn’t mind to know who it was as I carried my cement up the stairs of the building. All I cared is to get a Job.
	I returned home with my wage of 2500 naira and mumbled a greeting to my man as I went straight into my room. I looked in disgust at the piles of newspapers 
	scattered on my table due to Job-seeking. I lay on my bed facing the ceiling wondering how unfair life can be.
</p>
<div class="w3-container">

<div class="w3-container w3-orange w3-hover-red">
  
  <p>I felt my parents are already tired of me in the house.They are tired of me 
  consuming without providing anything in the house. Though they try to hide their weariness regarding me but its just there. I just feel it always.
I kept pondering on how to solve my present predicament and relocation was the only solution in my I could think of. Relocation to the big city, Lagos state. 
“Lagos is a land flowing with milk and honey. It’s a place of fast wealth” I always hear from people. 
I took a look at the time and I realized that It was 10:16pm and I made up my mind to leave for Lagos early the next morning.</br>
 I rose up from my bed and went to my parent’s room. I knocked at the door and waited for a response before getting in.
My mum was already asleep. I greeted “Good evening, Dad” as I got into their room.</p>

<div class="w3-container">

<div class="w3-container w3-white w3-hover-blue">
  
  <p>
 
“Nna, ke kwanu?” my Dad responded amid listening to the News from Arise FM on his radio.
“Dad” I began,”I came to inform you that I’ll be leaving for Lagos tomorrow morning”. He sharply gave a bewildered look at me.
“why?” He asked.
“Because, I need to hustle”
“what’s stopping you from hustling here in Ebonyi”
“There’s no hope nor future in Ebonyi, Dad”
“Says who? Where do you intend to stay when you get to Lagos?”  He asked with a surprised face
“I have nowhere at the moment and no one to go to but I will surely find my way in Lagos. It is always easy to make it there, all I need is to be hardworking and focused” I replied.
“My son, do not be deceived. You can be successful anywhere. You just need to be patient and put in more efforts”.
“But dad, it was same you who assured me that I will have millions of job looking for me provided I graduate with high grades. It’s been fours years since I served the country and yet I’m jobless. Despite having tried all my best to acquire one. I have written to different companies for job application even those that has no relation with what I studied in school but its the usual ‘we will get back to you’ and never have I  gotten any reasonable job offer although my certificate and interviews give good impressions”
“My son, it wasn’t like this during my time. It’s infelicitous that the system has changed completely this times but I’m convinced that God is going to grant you a job soon ” my dad said.
“How soon? For long will I wait?”
“My son, listen to me, life in the city is unbelievable. You get broken there. You are just a little boy and you may never find your way”.
I replied,”I know I could get lost, Dad. I know I could get broken.
 I know the city is too big for a young man like me who just wants to succeed in life and be able
 to support my family financially but my mind is already made. Forgive me father but I’ve got take a chance ”
  </p>

I left his room immediately and set to arrange my bag for my journey. I took a small bag and put in some clothes, my toothbrush, toothpaste, sponge, soap, hairbrush and anointing oil. I raised my mattress up and brought out my kolo. I broke it and counted my savings of four years.
“Just 100,250 naira!” I muttered disgustingly. I divided the money into three parts after removing #15,000 that I would use for my transportation. I hid a part in my boxers and the rest in my clothes.

Early in the morning by 4:30am, I was ready to leave the house and Ebonyi state for good. My  family bid me farewell while my dad offered me a 
parting gift of #10,000.

     <p>I spent my first three nights under the bridge when I got to Lagos whilst searching for an accommodation. I was later able to find a house I could manage with the little money I had. A small room in a congested public compound.
Immediately, I began job hunting that I became broke and haggard. No one ever said about how hard life can be, much harder than at Ebonyi State.
I gave up after a long fruitless job search and resorted to hawking in Traffic. I guessed this is the part you expect me to tell you that I met an old friend who is now wealthy and decided to bless my life.
Sorry to disappoint you but life isn’t a movie. Everyone is also struggling but on different levels anyways.</p>
